Q: How do I use Youtube Video Effects?
A: Just install our extension and keep using Youtube as usual. The FX button will automatically appear next to the three dots icon.

Q: How does it work?
A: This extension is possible thanks to a JavaScript library called glfx.js (Created by Evan Wallace, http://evanw.github.io/glfx.js) The library uses WebGL, which is an API for rendering interactive graphics in browser.
